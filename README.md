Terminal-based X/Twitter viewer with vim-style navigation.

## Install

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh):

```bash
bun install -g xfeed
```

> **Note:** `npm install` won't work - xfeed requires the Bun runtime.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.0
- A terminal with true color support (iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty, Warp)
- X/Twitter cookies in a supported browser (Safari, Chrome, Arc, Brave, Firefox)

## Usage

```bash
xfeed
```

On first run, you'll be prompted to select a browser to read cookies from.
